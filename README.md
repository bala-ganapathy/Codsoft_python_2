Task 2 (Password Genarator) :
This Python program is a password generator designed to create strong and secure passwords by ensuring a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. The program allows the user to specify the desired length of the password and guarantees that it includes at least one character from each category. The password is generated by first selecting one character from each type, then filling the rest with random characters from all available types. The characters are shuffled to avoid predictable patterns, and the final password is returned as a randomized string.
